# A simple Makefile to run C++
This Makefile searches automatically .cpp files in the source directory, and outs builded files to the build directory. You can configure the name of the source and build directories.

## Usage
Use `make` to compile your project, use `make run` to compile and run your project, use `make clean` to delete the build directory.
